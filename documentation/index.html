      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        MusicStats is a Web Application that aggregates various music 
        statistics and consumption patterns and makes them easy to visualize, 
        either through an interactive map or as raw data through a public 
        API.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        According to <i>The Verge</i>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/6/20852568/streaming-revenue-growth-spotify-apple-music-industry-ariana-grande-drake-taylor-swift">streaming made up over 80% of the music industry's total revenue</a>,
        far surpassing digital and physical music sales, which are now regarded as obsolete and outdated ways
        of consuming music.
      </p>
      <p>
        With so many streaming services competing over market share, it has become quite difficult
        to obtain a general overview of the music landscape - it is evident that certain genres 
        like <i>Pop</i> and <i>EDM</i> are incredibly popular on <i>Spotify</i>, while <i>Apple Music</i>
        audiences tend to prefer genres such as <i>Hip-hop</i> and <i>Trap</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        MusicStats aims to bridge the divide between these services by <b>aggregating</b> the data and
        <b>creating a visual model</b> that accurately correlates it to demographics, time periods and geographical
        location.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe such a service could be incredibly useful for a large number of people, from music
        enthusiasts who want to trace people with a similar music taste as theirs to music industry
        executives looking to capitalize on a trend to artists trying to carve out a niche for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goals are to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Allow the user to search for various statistics about songs, artists, genres etc.</li>
        <li>Get/scrape data from streaming services.</li>
        <li>Offer users an easy to understand visual representation of the data.</li>
        <li>Offer data analysts a Public API that lets them access raw data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Structure</h2>
      <p>
        MusicStats is a Web Application based on the MVC architecture. It offers a Public API
        as well as a User Interface.
      </p>
      <section id="Architecture">
        <!-- review? -->
        <h3>Application Overview</h3>
        <p>
          The diagram below presents an overview of the application and its architecture:
        </p>
        <img src="img/architecture.png" alt="architecture"/>
        <p>
          The application follows the <b>Model View Controller</b> pattern, having its 
          functionalities divided in three layers:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Model layer represents the data being sent to the <i>client</i> - in this particular case,
              the relevant music statistics pertinent to the user's search criteria.</li>
          <li><b>The View</b> layer represents what is shown to the client - it visualizes data from the 
              server and makes it user-comprehensible. In this particular case, the view is best 
              represented by the <i>Interactive Map</i> that plots the data received.</li>
          <li><b>The Controller</b> layer ties them together, taking client requests and piping back 
              the requested resources to the client. This layer also describes the collection of end-points
              used by the REST API.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <i>business logic</i> of the application is in the <b>Services</b> layer where the 
           the actual data collecting takes place.</p>
        <p>The <b>Repository</b> layer is where application data is persisted. In the case of MusicStats,
           the statistics that are created as per the client's request are cached for efficiency and 
           to avoid redundant look-ups - the statistics are pruned after a time to make sure they're not
           out of date.</p>

        <h3>Technology Stack</h3>
        <p>
          MusicStats is an <i>ES6</i> application in its entirety - the server uses the <i>NodeJS</i> runtime
          in conjunction with the <i>Express framework</i>. In addition, the server makes use of a non-relational 
          database called <i>MongoDB</i> together with the <i>Mongoose ODM</i>.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="clientServer">
        <!-- review? -->
        <h3>Client-Server Workflow</h3>
        <p>
          MusicStats is a <i>Single-Page Application</i>, meaning all the user interactions and the server responses 
          are confined to a single "page" - more explicitly, the server doesn't work in the traditional sense where 
          it would serve static HTML content for each page the user requests, but instead sends data over the HTTP 
          protocol in <i>JSON</i> format.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon visiting the starting page, the user is sent a blank HTML file and <i>JavaScript</i> code That
          fetches information from the server. Every user action sends an HTTP request over to the server,
          who then responds, and the response is handled by the client code.
        </p>
        <p>Below is a diagram explaining the relationship between the <i>Client</i> and the <i>Server</i>:</p>

          <h4>Server-side Services</h4>
          <p>Below are the essential <i>Services</i> at the core of MusicStats:</p>
          <section id="searchService">
            <h5>ElasticSearchService (Server)</h5>
            <code>
              search(searchQuery: SearchQuery)
            </code>
            <p>The <code>SearchQuery</code> object has the following schema:</p>
            <code>
              SearchQuery {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;genre: string[],<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;region: string[] (defaults to 'worldwide'),<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;startPeriod: date,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;endPeriod: date,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;song: string,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;artist: string[],<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;album: string,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;artistCountry: string,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;recordLabel: string,<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;producers: string[],<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;writers: string[]<br>
              };
            </code>
            <p>All the parameters are nullable, but a <code>SearchQuery</code> is considered to be
               redundant if it doesn't have at least one of the following parameters: <code>genre,
               song, artist, album;</code>
            </p>
            <p>The function returns a <code>SearchResponse</code> object:</p>
            <code>
                SearchResponse {<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;searchQuery: SearchQuery,<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;data: [<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;country: string,<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;popularity: number,<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;peakDate: date<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;},<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;]<br>
                };
              </code>
              <p>
                  The <code>popularity</code> field is determined using a formula that weighs streams 
                  based on whether they're <i>free streams</i> or <i>paid streams</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  First, <code>ElasticSearch</code> checks whether the <code>Search Query</code> has already 
                  been cached in the database - if it has, the retrieval is super quick because there is no need 
                  to fetch the data all over again.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the <code>SearchQuery</code> isn't in the Database, Elastic Search triggers the Scavenger Service 
                  for data retrieval.
              </p>
              <p>The Service also correlates the <code>SearchQuery</code> to other documents in the Database with 
                 similar parameters - for example, if the <code>SearchQuery</code> contains multiple genres, the 
                 service will aggregate data from all the records in the Database containing one of those genres and 
                 weighs them appropriately for generating statistics such as "people who listen to Pop-Rock also listen to 
                 Psychedelic Rock, Trance etc."</p>
          </section>
          <section id="scavengerService">
              <h5>ScavengerService</h5>
              <code>scavenge(searchQuery: SearchQuery): SearchResponse</code>
              <p><code>ScavengerService</code> deals with fetching data from public API's and/or web scraping
                 to obtain a <code>SearchResponse</code> object.</p>
              <p><code>ScavengerService</code> class has a member called <code>apiList</code>:</p>
              <code>apiList = [<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;apiEndPoint: 'https://api.spotify.com/search',<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;requiredParams: string[],<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;responseBody: {...},<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;},<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>
                    ];
              </code>
              <p>For each element of <code>apiList</code>, the scavenging service will attempt to fetch
                 as much relevant data as possible and will aggregate it in the end and streamline it into 
                 a cohesive <code>SearchResponse</code>.
              </p>
              <p>Upon obtaining a <code>SearchResponse</code>, the scavenging service caches it in the database.</p>
